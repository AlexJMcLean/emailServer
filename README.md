# Email Server

This is the code I have developed for use of my contact forms in my Portfolio.

This application will allow you to send a form from a contact form to an email sepecified under MAIL_USERNAME

Currently this application is set up to connect with a Gmail account, but can be easily changed to connect to a different Email client.

This application uses an Express server, and utilises the package Nodemailer to assist with the low level functionality of running an email server
